# Feature Specification

Feature specifications for nlp-mdsite. Each spec defines the purpose, requirements,
and named test cases for a feature area.

## Development Process

1. Write a spec here in `docs/specs/<feature>.md`
2. Implement the test cases in `tests/` (tests first — they should fail initially)
3. Implement the feature until all tests pass
4. The spec page appears in the site automatically after running `npm run ingest`
